## üîç Project Overview
RAG combines **document retrieval** and **language generation** to answer user queries efficiently.  
It extracts relevant text chunks from uploaded documents and generates **context-aware answers** using a Transformer model.

---

## üéØ Goal
To build an AI-powered system that provides **accurate answers from documents** in real-time, reducing manual reading effort.

---

## üìù Objectives
1. Extract and preprocess text from PDFs and text files.  
2. Split documents into meaningful chunks for semantic retrieval.  
3. Generate embeddings using **Sentence Transformers**.  
4. Store embeddings in **FAISS** for fast similarity search.  
5. Use a language model to generate informative responses.  
6. Provide an interactive query interface for real-time interaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Extract text from PDFs with `pdfplumber` and `PyPDF2`  
- Clean text (remove special characters, normalize spaces)  
- Split text into chunks for embedding

### Embedding & Retrieval
- Use **Sentence Transformers** to create vector embeddings  
- Store embeddings in **FAISS** for efficient semantic search  
- Retrieve top-k relevant chunks for a user query

### Response Generation
- Combine retrieved chunks with a query  
- Generate answers using a language model (GPT/transformer-based)  

### Evaluation
- Relevance of retrieved chunks  
- Accuracy and coherence of generated answers  
- Query response time
